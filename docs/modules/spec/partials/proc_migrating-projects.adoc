[role="_abstract"]
This section describes how to migrate projects to v2.x devfiles. A project specified in a v1.x devfile still works in a v2.x devfile.

.Procedure

A new `starterProject` project type can be defined in v2.x devfiles. Pick only one `starterProject` and use it in interactive mode. With a `starterProject`, you only need to copy your source code, so you no longer need to clone your Git repository.

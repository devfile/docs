= Deploying your devfile registry

Deploy your devfile registry so you can access the devfile stacks that provide you templates for containerized development

To use the devfile operator to deploy the devfile registry, you can use either:

* Operator lifecycle manager (OLM)
* Devfile registry helm chart

.Prerequisites
* To understand how to build your own devfile registry, see xref:building-custom-devfile-registry.adoc[].
* If you do not have publicly signed certificates for your cluster, disable TLS for the devfile registry so that you can use the devfile registry with OpenShift Do (odo).

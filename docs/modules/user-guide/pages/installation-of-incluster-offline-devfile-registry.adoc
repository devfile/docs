= Installation of In-Cluster Offline Devfile Registry

A devfile refers to various resources, such as container images and starter projects. The current devfile registry currently does not store those supporting resources. Therefore, you must have access to those resources when using those devfiles.

To support the air gap installation of the devfile registry, the air gap scenario divides into two stages:

. Build a devfile registry based on one or more source repositories so that the registry contains all the resources available for offline installation.
. Install the devfile registry to a cluster to make it available for users to access the registry.

= Building a custom devfile registry

Provide your developers a devfile registry so they can access devfile stacks, enabling them to use devfiles to simplify and quicken their containerized application development.

To create the devfile registry for your teamâ€™s container development:

. Create a git repository.
. Build a devfile registry.
. Tag and push the registry container image.

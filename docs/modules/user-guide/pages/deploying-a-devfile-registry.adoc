Deploy a devfile registry to allow access to the devfile stacks that provide templates for containerized development.

To use the devfile Operator to deploy a devfile registry, use:

* Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)
* Devfile registry Helm chart

.Prerequisites
* A built devfile registry container image. To build your own devfile registry, see xref:building-a-custom-devfile-registry.adoc[].
* If you do not have publicly signed certificates for your cluster, disable TLS for the devfile registry so that you can use the devfile registry with `odo`.

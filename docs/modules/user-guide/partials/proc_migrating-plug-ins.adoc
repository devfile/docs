= Migrating plug-ins

[role="_abstract"]
This section describes how to migrate plug-ins to a v2.x devfile. A plug-in specified in a `meta.yaml` for a v1.x devfile no longer works in a v2.x devfile.

Additionally, v2.x devfiles include the following new features:

* Parents allow users to reuse an existing devfile and partially replace plug-in functionality.
* Eclipse Che IDEs and their tooling can be specified as attributes in a v2.x devfile or in a distinct YAML file, for example: `.che/che-editor.yaml` or `.che/che-theia-plugin.yaml`.

= Adding commands to a devfile

[role="_abstract"]
A devfile allows you to specify commands to be available for execution in a workspace. Every command can contain a subset of actions. These subsets are related to specific components and are executed in the component containers. See the following tables for command properties in a devfile:

.commandObject
[cols="1,1,1,1"]
|===
|Key |Type| Required| Description

|exec
|execObject
|no
|The exec command to run.

|composite
|compositeObject
|no
|The composite command to run.
|===

.execObject
[cols="1,1,1,1"]
|===
|Key |Type| Required| Description

|id
|string
|yes
|The ID of the command.

|commandLine
|string
|yes
|The command to run.

|component
|string
|no
|The component to which the action relates.

|label
|string
|no
|The optional label to describe the command.

|workingDir
|string
|no
|The working directory where you execute the command.

|group
|groupObject
|no
|The group to which the command belongs.

|environment
|envObject
|no
|The list of environment variables you use.
|===

.compositeObject
[cols="1,1,1,1"]
|===
|Key |Type| Required| Description

|id
|string
|yes
|The ID of the command.

|commands
|string
|no
|The exec commands that constitute the composite command.

|parallel
|boolean
|no
|The flag that indicates if commands are executed in parallel.

|label
|string
|no
|The optional label to describe the command.

|group
|groupObject
|no
|The group to which the composite command belongs. The composite command cannot be of the `run` kind.
|===

.groupObject
[cols="1,1,1,1"]
|===
|Key |Type| Required| Description

|kind
|string
|yes
|The group to which the command belongs, such as: `build`, `run`, `test`, and `debug`.

|isDefault
|boolean
|no
|Identifies if it is the default command to run. Only one default command can be defined for each group.

.Prerequisites

* xref:adding-schema-version-to-a-devfile.adoc[]
* xref:adding-a-name-to-a-devfile.adoc[]
* xref:adding-projects-to-a-devfile.adoc[]


.Procedure

. Add a `commands` section in the devfile, containing a list of one or more commands.

. For each command, define an unique value for the mandatory `id` attribute.

. For each command, define a mandatory type of one of the following types:

* `exec`
* `apply`
* `composite`

+
.Sample command
[source,yaml]
----
 commands:
   - id: build
     exec:
      component: mysql
      commandLine: mvn clean
      workingDir: /projects/spring-petclinic
----

. Define attributes for the `exec` command to run using the default shell in the container.
+
 * A `commandLine` attribute that is a command to execute.
 * A `component` attribute that specifies the container in which to execute the command.

[NOTE]

* A command can have only one action, though you can use `composite` commands to execute several commands either sequentially or in parallel.

. Command group
+
To assign a given command to one or more groups that represent the nature of the command, use the following supported group types:
+
* `build`
* `run`
* `test`
* `debug`
+
For each of the groups, define one default command by specifying the `isDefault` value.

----

. Composite command
+
To chain multiple commands together, define a composite command. To reference the individual commands that are called from a composite command, use the `name` of the command. To specify whether commands within a composite command are to be executed sequentially or in parallel, define the `parallel` boolean.

= Building a devfile registry

[role="_abstract"]
Make your repository into a devfile registry by building a `devfile index` container image. Deploy the `devfile index` image and the `Open Containers Initiative (OCI) registry image` to your cloud or cluster to form the devfile registry.

.Prerequisites
* Golang 1.13.x or higher
* Docker 17.05 or higher
* Git

.Procedure

. Run `./build_image.sh <path-to-devfile-registry-folder>` to  build a devfile registry repository.
. In a multi-stage Docker build, add a Dockerfile to your devfile registry repository. Make sure the Dockerfile contains the following:
+
.A Dockerfile
====
----
FROM quay.io/openshift-pipeline/golang:1.15-alpine AS builder

# Install dependencies
RUN apk add --no-cache git bash

COPY . /registry

# Download the registry build tools
RUN git clone https://github.com/devfile/registry-support.git /registry-support

# Run the registry build tools
RUN /registry-support/build-tools/build.sh /registry /build

FROM quay.io/devfile/devfile-index-base:next

COPY --from=builder /build/index.json /index.json
COPY --from=builder /build/stacks /stacks
----
====

. Run `docker build -t devfile-index` to build the devfile registry into a container image.

The build script builds the index generator, generates the index.json from the specified devfile registry, and builds the stacks and index.json into a devfile index container image. The registry build process takes the contents of your devfile registry Git repository and:

. Packages each devfile stackâ€™s contents based on the supported media types for the devfile registry.
. Validates the content of the devfile registry repository based on the expected registry structure.
. Generates the index.json from the stacks in the repository and from any extra stacks or samples mentioned in the file, `extraDevfileEntries.yaml`.
. Builds a `devfile index` container image with the devfile stack contents and index.json.

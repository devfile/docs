= Migrating projects

[role="_abstract"]
There are NO major changes in the `projects` section of the devfile. A project specified in a v1.0 devfile will work as it is in a devfile v2.0.

.Procedure

*  The only major change is the addition of a new kind of project: `starterProjects`. Those are supposed to be used in interactive mode only (user pick one) and the git repo get not be cloned but only source code get copied (kind of what `git archive --remote=<repository URL> | tar -t` would do).

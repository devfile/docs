This section describes how to migrate projects to v2.0 devfiles. A project specified in a v1.0 devfile still works in a v2.0 devfile.

.Procedure

A major change in v2.0 devfile is the addition of a new kind of project: `starterProjects`. You should only pick one `starterProject` and only use this project in interactive mode. Also, you only need to copy your source code. You no longer need to clone your git repo.

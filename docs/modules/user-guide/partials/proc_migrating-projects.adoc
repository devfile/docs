This section describes how to migrate projects to devfiles v2.x. A project specified in a devfile v1.x still works in a devfile v2.x.

.Procedure

A major change in devfiles v2.x is the addition of a new kind of project: `starterProjects`. You should only pick one `starterProject` and only use this project in interactive mode. Also, you only need to copy your source code. You no longer need to clone your git repo.

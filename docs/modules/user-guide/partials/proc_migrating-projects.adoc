This section describes how to migrate projects to devfiles v2.x. A project specified in a devfile v1.x still works in a devfile v2.x.

.Procedure

<<<<<<< HEAD
 Devfiles v2.x has a new kind of project: `starterProjects`. Pick only one `starterProject` and use it in interactive mode. With a `starterProject`, you only need to copy your source code, so you no longer need to clone your git repository.

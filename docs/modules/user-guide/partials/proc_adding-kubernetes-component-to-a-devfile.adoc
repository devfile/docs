= Adding `kubernetes` component to a devfile

[role="_abstract"]
This section describes how to add a `kubernetes` component to a devfile. A complex component type that allows to apply configuration from a list of Kubernetes or OpenShift components.

.Procedure

. Define a component using the type `kubernetes`.

. The content can be provided through the `reference` attribute, which points to the file with the component content.

.Adding `kubernetes` component using the `reference` attribute
====
[source,yaml]
----
  components:
    - name: mysql
      kubernetes:
        reference: petclinic.yaml
        selector:
          app.kubernetes.io/name: mysql
          app.kubernetes.io/component: database
          app.kubernetes.io/part-of: petclinic
----
====

. Alternatively, to post a devfile with such components to REST API, the contents of the Kubernetes or OpenShift list can be embedded into the devfile using the `referenceContent` field:

.Adding `kubernetes` component using the `referenceContent` attribute
====
[source,yaml]
----
  components:
    - name: mysql
      kubernetes:
        reference: petclinic.yaml
        referenceContent: |
             kind: List
             items:
              -
               apiVersion: v1
               kind: Pod
               metadata:
                name: ws
               spec:
                containers:
               ... etc
----
====

. Overriding container entrypoints. As with the xref:component-type-container{context}[`container` component], it is possible to override the entrypoint of the containers contained in the Kubernetes or OpenShift list using the `command` and `args` properties (as link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/#notes[understood] by Kubernetes).
+
There can be more containers in the list (contained in Pods or Pod templates of deployments). It is therefore necessary to select which containers to apply the entrypoint changes to as follows:
+
.Overriding container entrypoints
====
[source,yaml]
----
  components:
    - name: appDeployment
      kubernetes:
        reference: app-deployment.yaml
        entrypoints:
        - parentName: mysqlServer
          command: ['sleep']
          args: ['infinity']
        - parentSelector:
          app: prometheus
          args: ['-f', '/opt/app/prometheus-config.yaml']
----
====
+
The `entrypoints` list contains constraints for picking the containers along with the `command` and `args` parameters to apply to them. In the example above, the constraint is `parentName: mysqlServer`, which will cause the command to be applied to all containers defined in any parent object called `mysqlServer`. The parent object is assumed to be a top level object in the list defined in the referenced file, which is `app-deployment.yaml` in the example above.
+
Other types of constraints (and their combinations) are possible:
+
`containerName`:: the name of the container
`parentName`:: the name of the parent object that (indirectly) contains the containers to override
`parentSelector`:: the set of labels the parent object needs to have
+
A combination of these constraints can be used to precisely locate the containers inside the referenced Kubernetes list.

. Overriding container environment variables
+
To provision or override entrypoints in a Kubernetes or OpensShift component, configure it in the following way:
+
.Overriding container environment variables
====
[source,yaml]
----
  components:
    - name: appDeployment
      kubernetes:
        reference: app-deployment.yaml
        env:
          - name: ENV_VAR
            value: value
----
====
+
This is useful for temporary content or without access to editing the referenced content. The specified environment variables are provisioned into each init container and containers inside all Pods and Deployments.

. Specifying mount-source option
+
To specify a project sources directory mount into container(s), use the `mountSources` parameter:
+
.Specifying mount-source option
====
[source,yaml]
----
   components:
      - name: appDeployment
        kubernetes:
          reference: app-deployment.yaml
          mountSources: true
----
====
+
If enabled, project sources mounts will be applied to every container of the given component.
This parameter is also applicable for `plugin` type components.

= Migrating schema version

[role="_abstract"]
This section describes how to migrate a schema version to v2.0 devfiles. A schema version specified in a v1.0 devfile still works in a v2.0 devfile.

To migrate a schema version from v1.0 devfiles to v2.0 devfiles, replace `apiVersion: 1.0.0` with `schemaVersion: 2.0.0`.

For an example, see the following yaml:

[cols="1a,1a"]
|====
|
[source,yaml]
----
v1.0
---
apiVersion: 1.0.0
metadata:
  name: devfile-sample
----
|
[source,yaml]
----
v2.0
---
schemaVersion: 2.0.0
metadata:
  name: devfile-sample
----
|====

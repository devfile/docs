= Defining Kubernetes resources

[role="_abstract"]
Complex deployments can be described using Kubernetes or OpenShift resource lists that can be referenced in the devfile. This makes them a part of the workspace

.Procedure

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Because a {prod-short} workspace is internally represented as a single deployment, all resources from the Kubernetes or OpenShift list are merged into that single deployment.

* Be careful when designing such lists because this can result in name conflicts and other problems.

* Only the following subset of the Kubernetes objects are supported: `deployments`, `pods`, `services`, `persistent volume claims`, `secrets`, and `config maps`. Kubernetes Ingresses are ignored, but OpenShift routes are supported. A workspace created from a devfile using any other object types fails to start.

* When running {prod-short} on a Kubernetes cluster, only Kubernetes lists are supported. When running {prod-short} on an OpenShift cluster, both Kubernetes and OpenShift lists are supported.

schemaVersion: 2.0.0
metadata:
  name: MyDevfile
projects:
  - name: my-go-project
    clonePath: go/src/github.com/acme/my-go-project
    git:
      remotes:
        origin: "https://github.com/acme/my-go-project.git"
components:
  - name: MyDevfile
    kubernetes:
      reference: ../relative/path/postgres.yaml
----

The preceding component references a file that is relative to the location of the devfile itself. Meaning, this devfile is only loadable by a {prod-short} factory to which you supply the location of the devfile and therefore it is able to figure out the location of the referenced Kubernetes resource list.

The following is an example of the `postgres.yaml` file.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: List
items:

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
        name: postgres
        labels:
            app: postgres
    spec:
        template:
        metadata:
            name: postgres
            app:
                name: postgres
        spec:
            containers:
            - image: postgres
              name: postgres
              ports:
              - name: postgres
                containerPort: 5432
                volumeMounts:
                - name: pg-storage
                  mountPath: /var/lib/postgresql/data
            volumes:
            - name: pg-storage
              persistentVolumeClaim:
                  claimName: pg-storage
-
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
        name: postgres
        labels:
            app: postgres
            name: postgres
    spec:
        ports:
            - port: 5432
              targetPort: 5432
        selector:
            app: postgres
-
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
    metadata:
        name: pg-storage
      labels:
        app: postgres
    spec:
        accessModes:
         - ReadWriteOnce
        resources:
            requests:
                storage: 1Gi

For a basic example of a devfile with an associated Kubernetes or OpenShift list, see link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/devfile/tree/master/samples/web-nodejs-with-db-sample[web-nodejs-with-db-sample] on redhat-developer GitHub.

If you use generic or large resource lists from which you will only need a subset of resources, you can select particular resources from the list using a selector (which, as the usual Kubernetes selectors, works on the labels of the resources in the list).

[source,yaml]
----
schemaVersion: 2.0.0
metadata:
  name: MyDevfile
projects:
  - name: my-go-project
    clonePath: go/src/github.com/acme/my-go-project
    git:
      remotes:
        origin: "https://github.com/acme/my-go-project.git"
components:
  - name: MyDevfile
    kubernetes:
      reference: ../relative/path/postgres.yaml
      selector:
        app: postgres
----

Additionally, it is also possible to modify the entrypoints (command and arguments) of the containers present in the resource list. For details of the advanced use case, see the reference (TODO: link).

= Migrating commands

[role="_abstract"]
This section describes how to migrate the `commands` section to devfiles v2.x. A command specified in a devfile v1.x does not work in a devfile v2.x.

.Procedure

. Command groups: build, run, test, debug.
. Apply command.
. Environment variables for a specific command.
. Renaming workdir into workingDir.
. Id and label for composite commands.
. Run exec commands as specific user.
. Devfile metadata: add a link to an external website.
. Stack and devfile matching rules.

[role="_abstract"]
This section describes how to migrate commands to v2.0 devfiles. The command section of v2.0 devfile has major changes. A command specified in a v1.0 devfile no longer works in a v2.0 devfile.

.Procedure

. Command groups: build, run, test, debug.
. Apply command.
. Environment variables for a specific command.
. Renaming workdir into workingDir.
. Id and label for composite commands.
. Run exec commands as specific user.
. Devfile metadata: add a link to an external website.
. Stack or devfile matching rules.

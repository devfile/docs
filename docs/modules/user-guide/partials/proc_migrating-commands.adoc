This section describes how to migrate the `commands` section to v2.x devfiles. A command specified in a v1.x devfile does not work in a v2.x devfile.

.Procedure

. Command groups: build, run, test, debug.
. Apply command.
. Environment variables for a specific command.
. Renaming workdir into workingDir.
. Id and label for composite commands.
. Run exec commands as specific user.
. Devfile metadata: add a link to an external website.
. Stack and devfile matching rules.

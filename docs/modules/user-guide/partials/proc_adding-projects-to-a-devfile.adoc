[role="_abstract"]
This section describes how to add one or more projects to a devfile.


.Prerequisites

* xref:adding-schema-version-to-a-devfile.adoc[]
* xref:adding-a-name-to-a-devfile.adoc[]


.Procedure

. Add a `projects` section in the devfile, containing a list of one or more projects.

+
.A minimal devfile with one single project
====
[source,yaml]
----
schemaVersion: 2.0.0
metadata:
  name: petclinic-dev-environment
projects:
  - name: petclinic
    git:
      location: 'https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git'
      branch: master
----
====
+
.A devfile with multiple projects
====
[source,yaml]
----
schemaVersion: 2.0.0
metadata:
  name: example-devfile
projects:
- name: frontend
  git:
    location: https://github.com/acmecorp/frontend.git
- name: backend
  git:
    location: https://github.com/acmecorp/backend.git
----
====

. For each project, define an unique value for the mandatory `name` attribute.



. For each project, define a mandatory source of one of the following types: `git`, `github` and `zip`.

`git`:: Projects with sources in Git. The location points to a clone link.
+
.Project-source type: git
====
[source,yaml]
----
projects:
  - name: my-project1
    git:
      remotes:
        origin: "https://github.com/my-org/project1.git"
      checkoutFrom:
        revision: master           <1>
      tag: 7.2.0
      commitId: 36fe587
      branch: master
----
<1> `startPoint` is the general value for `tag`, `commitId`, and `branch`. The `startPoint`, `tag`, `commitId`, and `branch` parameters are mutually exclusive. When more than one is supplied, the following order is used: `startPoint`, `tag`, `commitId`, `branch`.
====

`github`:: Same as `git` but for projects hosted on link:https://github.com/[GitHub] only. Use `git` for projects that do not use GitHub-specific features.

`zip`:: Projects with sources in a ZIP archive. Location points to a ZIP file.
+
.Project-source type: zip
====
[source,yaml]
----
source:
    zip:
      location: http://host.net/path/project-src.zip
----
====


. For each project, define the optional `clonePath` attribute to specify the path into which the project is to be cloned. The path must be relative to the `/projects/` directory, and it cannot leave the `/projects/` directory. The default value is the project name.
+
.Defining the `clonePath` attribute
====
[source,yaml]
----
schemaVersion: 2.0.0
metadata:
  name: my-project-dev
projects:
  - name: my-project-resource
    clonePath: resources/my-project
    zip:
      location: http://host.net/path/project-res.zip
  - name: my-project2
      git:
        remotes:
          origin: "https://github.com/my-org/project2.git"
        checkoutFrom:
          revision: develop
----
====

. For each project, define the optional `sparseCheckoutDir` attribute to populate the project sparsely with selected directories.
+
[NOTE]
====
* Set to `/my-module/` to create only the root `my-module` directory (and its content).

* Omit the leading slash (`my-module/`) to create all `my-module` directories that exist in the project. Including, for example, `/addons/my-module/`.
+
The trailing slash indicates that only directories with the given name (including their content) are created.

* Use wildcards to specify more than one directory name. For example, setting `module-*` checks out all directories of the given project that start with `module-`.

== Stage 2: Install a Devfile Registry to a cluster

In this stage, install the images to the offline image registry.

.Prerequisites

* Docker 17.05 or higher or Podman 4.0.x or higher
* OpenShift Container Platform 4.6 or higher

=== Install Image into Cluster Image Registry

The process of installing the built images into an offline image registry depends on which image registry has deployed and which image registry you have access to.

.Procedure

. OpenShift Image Registry
+
Use the `docker tag` or the `podman tag` to retag the image using the form `<registry_ip>:<port>/<project>/<image>`:
+
[source,bash]
----
podman tag localhost/devfile-index <registry_ip>:<port>/<project>/devfile-index
----
+
Use the `docker push` or `podman push` to push the retagged image to the OpenShift Image Registry at `<registry_ip>:<port>`:
+
[source,bash]
----
podman push <registry_ip>:<port>/<project>/devfile-index
----

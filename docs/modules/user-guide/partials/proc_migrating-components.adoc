[role="_abstract"]
This section describes how to migrate components to devfiles v2.x. A component specified in a devfile v1.x no longer works in a devfile v2.x.

.Procedure

. Component is a polymorphic type
+
To get a better syntax validation, define a component as a polymorphic type and implement it as `container`, `kubernetes`, `openshift`, `plugin` or `volume`.

[source,yaml]

components:
  - name: mydevfile
  - container:
        image: maven
        ...
  - container:
        image: nodejs
        ...
  - kubernetes:
       uri: https://.../mongo.yaml

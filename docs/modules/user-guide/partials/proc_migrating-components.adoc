[role="_abstract"]
This section describes how to migrate components to v2.0 devfiles. A component specified in a v1.0 devfile no longer works in a v2.0 devfile.

To get a better syntax validation, define a component as a polymorphic type and implement it as a `container`, `kubernetes`, `openshift`, `plugin` or `volume`.

For an example, see the following yaml:

<<<<<<< HEAD
. Component is a polymorphic type
+
For a better syntax validation component now is defined as a polymorphic type and can be implemented as `container`, `kubernetes`, `openshift`, `plugin` or `volume`.

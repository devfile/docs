This section describes how to migrate components to devfiles v2.x. The components section of devfiles v2.x has major changes. A component specified in a devfile v1.x no longer works in a devfile v2.x.

For a better syntax validation component now is defined as a polymorphic type and can be implemented as `container`, `kubernetes`, `openshift`, `plugin` or `volume`.

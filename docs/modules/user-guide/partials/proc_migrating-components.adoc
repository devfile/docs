= Migrating components

[role="_abstract"]
This section describes how to migrate components to devfile v2. There ARE major changes in the `components` section of the devfile. A component specified in a v1.0 devfile will NOT work as it is in a devfile v2.0.

.Procedure

. Component is a polymophic type
+
For a better syntax validation component now is defined as a polymorphic type and can be implemented as `container`, `kubernetes`, `openshift`, `plugin` or `volume`.

components:
  - container:
        image: maven

  - container:
        image: nodejs
        ...
  - kubernetes:

. Shared Volumes Across Components. See https://github.com/che-incubator/devworkspace-api/issues/19[corresponding issue].

. Out of Main Pod Compoenents. See  https://github.com/devfile/api/issues/48[corresponding issue].

. Replace Alias with Name. See  https://github.com/che-incubator/devworkspace-api/issues/9[corresponding issue].

. Renaming dockerimage component type. See  https://github.com/che-incubator/devworkspace-api/issues/8[corresponding issue].

. Specify sources path for containers. See  https://github.com/che-incubator/devworkspace-api/issues/17[corresponding issue].

. Specify size of volume for component. See https://github.com/che-incubator/devworkspace-api/issues/14[corresponding issue].

. Containers endpoints (routes/ingresses). See https://github.com/che-incubator/devworkspace-api/issues/33[corresponding issue].

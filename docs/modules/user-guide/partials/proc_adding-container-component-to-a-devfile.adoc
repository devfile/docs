= Adding `container` components to a devfile

[role="_abstract"]
To incorporate custom tools into the workspace, you can define an image-based configuration of a container in a workspace. You can do this by using the `container` component type. 

A devfile can contain one or more components of the `container` type. The `component name` attribute identifies each component, including the container.

.Procedure

. Define a component using the type `container`.

.A `container` component
[source,yaml]
----
 components:
   - name: maven
     container:
      image: eclipse/maven-jdk8:latest
      volumeMounts:
        - name: mavenrepo
          path: /root/.m2
       env:
         - name: ENV_VAR
           value: value
       endpoints:
         - name: maven-server
           targetPort: 3101
           protocol: https
           secure: 'true'
           exposure: public
       memoryRequest: 256M
       memoryLimit: 1536M
       cpuRequest: 0.1
       cpuLimit: 0.5
       command: ['tail']
       args: ['-f', '/dev/null']

.A minimal `container` component
[source,yaml]
----
schemaVersion: 2.1.0
metadata:
    name: mydevfile
components:
  - name: go
    container:
      image: golang
      memoryLimit: 512Mi
      command: ['sleep', 'infinity']
----
+
Specify the type of component using the `container` attribute. Use the `image` attribute to specify the image for the component. When defining the `image`, use container naming conventions. For example, the `image` attribute in the preceding example refers to the container image,  `docker.io/library/golang:latest`.
+
Use the `container` component to augment the image with additional resources and information. By augmenting this image, you allow for integrating the tooling provided by the image with the application that consumes the devfile.

. Mounting project sources
+
For the `container` component to have access to the project sources, you must set the `mountSources` attribute to `true`.
+
[source,yaml]
----
schemaVersion: 2.1.0
metadata:
    name: mydevfile
components:
  - name: go
    container:
      image: golang
      memoryLimit: 512Mi
      mountSources: true
      command: ['sleep', 'infinity']
----
+
The sources are mounted on a location stored in the `PROJECTS_ROOT` environment variable that is made available in the running container of the image. This location defaults to `/projects`. If `sourceMapping` is defined in the container, it overrides the `PROJECT_ROOT` value and mounts the source to the path defined by `sourceMapping`.

. Container Entrypoint
+
Use the `command` attribute of the `container` type to modify the `entrypoint` command of the container created from the image. The availability of the `sleep` command and the support for the `infinity` argument depend on the base image used in the particular images.

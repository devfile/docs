[role="_abstract"]

Use the the `exec` command to automate the container actions. 

. Define attributes for the `exec` command to run using the default shell in the container.

 * A `commandLine` attribute that is a command to run.
 * A `component` attribute that specifies the container in which to run the command. The `component` attribute value must correspond to an existing container component name.

[NOTE]
A command can have only one action, though you can use `composite` commands to run several commands either in sequence or in parallel.

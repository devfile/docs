= Creating a Devfile stack

[role="_abstract"]
Create a devfile stack to package into the devfile registry so you can quickly access, share, and duplicate your different stacks for your various projects.

.Procedure

. Create a stack folder with a name that matches the stack name. For example, `java-wildfly/`.
. Create version directories for storing different stack versions. Each directory under the stack must correspond to a specific version, for example, `java-wildfly/1.0.0`.
. Create a `stack.yaml` file to store the stack information.
. Verify every devfile stack version contains at least one `devfile.yaml` file. Add other required files to the stack version. These files can include VSX plug-ins, Dockerfiles, or Kubernetes manifests.

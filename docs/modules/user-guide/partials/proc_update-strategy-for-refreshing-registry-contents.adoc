== Update strategy for refreshing registry contents

Steps to update an already deployed registry in the air gap scenario:

. Rerun the registry build script to rebuild the devfile registry and package up the devfile registry that contains all the resources available for offline installation.
. Update the existing devfile registry deployment with the new devfile registry to make it available for users to access the registry.

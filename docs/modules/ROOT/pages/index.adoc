:description: Software Defined Development Environments

Devfiles describe and define a cloud native development environment.

Devfiles are consumed by tools that transform the definition into a cloud workspace composed of multiple cloud native resources. Any number of identical workspaces can be created from the same devfile. They can be shared in various ways including a devfile registry or together with the source code of a project.
